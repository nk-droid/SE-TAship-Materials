### Decision Tree

A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is structured like a tree, where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, branches denote possible outcomes, and leaf nodes represent final class labels or continuous values.

#### How Decision Trees Work
1. The dataset is split into subsets based on feature values using criteria like Gini Impurity or Information Gain.
2. The process continues recursively until a stopping condition is met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf).
3. The final tree is used to make predictions by traversing from the root to a leaf node.

#### Advantages
- Simple to understand and visualize.
- Requires little data preprocessing.
- Handles both numerical and categorical data.

#### Disadvantages
- Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.
- Can be sensitive to noisy data.
- Does not generalize well without pruning or ensemble methods.

#### Applications
- Medical diagnosis
- Credit risk assessment
- Customer segmentation

### Future Trends
Decision Trees are often combined with ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to improve accuracy and robustness, making them a core part of modern machine learning applications.
