## Introduction

This repository contains all notebooks and other teaching materials that I have used and developed during my time as a Teaching Assistant. These resources are intended to assist students in understanding various concepts and to provide additional exercises and examples.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```plaintext
.
├── notebooks/
│   └── How_to_inference_HuggingFace_Models.ipynb
└── README.md
```

- `notebooks/` directory contains all the notebooks used during the sessions.
